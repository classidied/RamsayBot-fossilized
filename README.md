defunct-- currentely being converted and improved in js :D

With prefix `~`, Ramsay Bot is readied to cure or deepen your depression at your beck and will. Now that he is a bot, he will always be with you. You cannot escape. 

Including callable functions such as: 
- insult (self explanatory) 
- encourage (self explanatory)
- idiot <@member> (sandwich :D)
- recipe <optional-keyword> (sends you a random recipe w/o a keyword, or 1-3 relevant ones based on the keyword)
- alarm <@member> (wakes up your friends!)
- bruh (reaction image!)
  
As well as non-controllable functions:
  - there are 3 different words that when typed, will invoke Gordon Ramsay himself to personally send his favorite photos of himself to the server
  - Ramsay is known as nothing else than the world's greatest samaritian, a saint among Jesus himself, thus it is only fitting that he protects all the young, unfortunate souls who fall for obscenely overused jokes ("who's joe")
